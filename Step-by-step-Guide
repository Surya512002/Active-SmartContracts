1.)Deployment Steps (Quick Refresher)
       
        Compile: In Remix, select the compiler tab and click Compile BuyMeACoffee.sol.

        Environment: Go to the "Deploy" tab. Ensure Environment is Injected Provider - MetaMask.

        Deploy: Click the orange Deploy button.

  Note: This does not cost extra money besides the gas fee (approx $0.10).

2.)How to Use It (To increase your "Active" score)
             
            This contract is unique because it requires ETH to work. This generates a different kind of on-chain footprint.

            Test it yourself:  In Remix, look at your deployed contract under "Deployed Contracts".

   Expand the buyCoffee function.

             CRITICAL STEP: In the "Value" box at the top left of the Remix panel, type 0.0001 and change the dropdown from Wei to Ether. (If you don't do this, the transaction will fail because the contract rejects 0 ETH).

             Enter a name (e.g., "Self") and message ("Testing").

Click transact.

Withdraw:

Click the withdrawTips button to pull that ETH back into your wallet.

3.) Verification (Required for Builder Score)
Don't forget to verify this new contract on Basescan just like the last one.

Contract Address: Copy from Remix.

Compiler Version: Match the one in Remix (usually 0.8.x).

Optimization: No (unless you turned it on).

Why this helps your score: Having multiple verified contracts of different types (Data vs. Payments) is a strong signal to the Talent Protocol algorithm that you are an active developer, not just a bot.
